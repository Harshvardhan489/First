# First
1)Name of Project:Fastagram

2)Tech stack: HTML,CSS,ATOM,Chrome.

 I tried to make a prototype of one kind of Social Media page which i named "Fastagram".I made this on the basis of what
 I learned from the progate courses of html and css course.I tried to make use of all the things which i learned. 
 First,I start to write HTML code in Atom.I divided in main three patrs heading,mid,footer and then also divided them according my
 needs.I also used CSS to make a nice webpage.I used properties like position,active,hover,button,img,margin,padding etc.
 Because of lack of time I am not adding media queries and comments in my code right now.As i am beginner with HTML and CSS my page 
 is a static page not a dynamic page.
